A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interface controllers (NICs) of network devices. It is a hardware address that is permanently assigned by the manufacturer and is stored in the device's firmware or read-only memory (ROM). MAC addresses are used at the data link layer of the OSI model to ensure that data is delivered to the correct device within a local network.

MAC addresses are typically 48 bits in length and are expressed as a sequence of six pairs of hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens. For example, a MAC address may look like "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E". The first three pairs of digits identify the manufacturer of the network interface card, while the last three pairs provide a unique identifier for the specific device.

MAC addresses play a crucial role in Ethernet networks, as they allow devices to communicate with each other within a local area network (LAN). When data is sent from one device to another on the same network, it is encapsulated within Ethernet frames that contain the source and destination MAC addresses. Routers and switches use these MAC addresses to forward the data to the appropriate destination.

It's important to note that MAC addresses are specific to the local network and do not have global uniqueness like IP addresses. They are only relevant within the scope of the local network segment. When data needs to be transmitted beyond the local network, it is encapsulated in network packets that contain source and destination IP addresses.

In summary, a MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to the network interface controller of a device. It is used at the data link layer to facilitate communication within a local network. MAC addresses are hardware-based, manufacturer-specific, and differ from IP addresses, which are used for network communication on a larger scale.
