## Reconnaissance Tips

- Keep your browser's 'Network' Developer Tool open while broswing a web application to see how the app loads data

- 'File' and 'Path' fuzzing
    - Finding Backup logs
        - Use a wordlist of dates (ex. 2022-01-01, 20240101, 2022-01-01T00:00:00, etc.)
        - Use `-e` to search for multiple file extension types (ex. `-e log,txt`)
- Recursion [1](https://youtu.be/0v1CTSyRpMU?si=0b5i_1Y0PEw06hGS&t=299 "NahamSec: What is Fuzzing")
    - Recursion causes the fuzzer to search for files and folders within any folders it finds within the original target
        - `Found: /admin/`, `Beginning new Search: /admin/*/`
- Response Codes
    - Search on 200,204,301,302,307,401,403,405,415
        - ffuf argument: `-mc 200,204,301,302,307,401,403,405,415`
    - What to do when all targets return a '200' [(1)](https://youtu.be/0v1CTSyRpMU?si=G8AL5ThITsM6RlFm&t=572 "NahamSec: What is Fuzzing")
        - Filter by file size:
            - Find the repeated values in '200' returns
                - Exclude on: file size
                    - ffuf argument: `-fs 699`
                - Exclude on: word count
                    - ffuf argument: `-fw 126`


## Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
**Definition**: A type of security vulnerability that "arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly."[S](https://web.archive.org/web/20240328165820/https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor "Definition Source")

### Steps for Indentifying IDOR:
1. Notice where user's entered data is reflected in the application
2. Look for places where user generated data is directly referenced
3. Use a proxy engine to replay/repeat requests that contain static data

**Important**: Just because a `GET` request doesn't work, or is blocked, doesn't mean a `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` request won't work.

### Exploiting IDOR Vulnerabilities:
1. *Incrementing/Decrementing Identifiers*: Manually change the identifier values in the URL or request parameters to see if you can access other users' data.
    - Example: If the URL is `https://example.com/account?id=123`, try changing `id=123` to `id=124` or `id=122`.
2. *Predictable Identifiers*: Look for patterns in the identifiers used by the application. If the identifiers follow a predictable sequence (e.g., user IDs increment by 1), you can exploit this by guessing other valid identifiers.
    - Example: If you notice that user IDs are sequential, you can try accessing `https://example.com/account?id=124`, `https://example.com/account?id=125`, etc.
3. *Parameter Manipulation*: Modify request parameters that reference objects directly to see if you can gain unauthorized access. This can include URL parameters, form fields, or JSON payloads.
    - Example: If a form submission includes a hidden field like `<input type="hidden" name="user_id" value="123">`, try changing the value to `124` before submitting the form.


## Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
**Definition**: A type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to make requests to internal systems or resources from a server.

### Steps for Indentifying SSRF:
1. Look for places where users can input URLs. This could be integrations with third-party tools, screenshot tools, or PDF generators.
2. Check if the request is being made server-side. You can do this by looking at the IP address that makes the request. If it's the server's IP address, then the request is being made server-side.
3. If the request is being made server-side, try to see if you can access internal resources. This could include reading local files, accessing internal hosts, or sending data.

What SSRF is *NOT*:

    - A request from the client (ex. a browser)
    - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): CSRF involves tricking a user into making unwanted requests to another site where they are authenticated.

### Exploiting SSRF Vulnerabilities:

1. *Internal Network Access*: Craft malicious URLs that access internal network services and resources, which are otherwise unaccessible to your external machine.
2. *Sensitive Data Retrieval*: Use SSRF to access internal APIs or services that may return sensitive information, such as configuration files, credentials, or user data.
3. *Port Scanning*: Exploit SSRF to perform port scanning on the internal network, identifying open ports and services that may be vulnerable.
4. *Metadata Services*: In cloud environments, use SSRF to access metadata services (e.g., AWS EC2 metadata service) to retrieve instance credentials and other sensitive information.
    - Try querying https://169.254.169.254/metadata
        - Look for metadata keys that you can use to login


## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Definition**: A type of security vulnerability that essentially allows attackers to execute some code in a vulnerable web application. There are three main types of XSS:
- Reflected XSS, where malicious code comes from the current HTTP request
- Stored XSS, where malicious code comes from the server's database
- DOM-based XSS, where vulnerablities exist in client-side code rather than server-side code

**Notes**:
- Your injection payload *must* close out whatever context it's in (ex. `</script>`, `</title>`, `</p>`), therefore, **copy/pasting payloads is WOEFULLY inefficient**.
    - First, observe the applications client-side code for the context a given input field is in. The start of your payload is the closing of that context.
- Break out of Context using comments:
    - JavaScript: `//`
    - HTML: `<!-- -->`

### Steps for Indentifying Reflected XSS:
1. Note down every user input field you can find in the application (Ex. URL parameters, form fields, etc.)
2. Confirm that you can reflect JavaScript code in the web application
3. Having trouble? Ensure your payload closes the context it's in.

### Exploiting XSS Vulnerabilities:
1. Test all input fields using simple elements
    - Ex. `"><u>test123`
2. Add an event handler to your element to further test your control over the application
    - Ex. `<u/onmouseover=alert(document.cookie)>test123`; `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`

### Examples of Reflected XSS:

#### JavaScript

Consider a web application that includes user input in an HTML attribute without proper sanitization:

```javascript
var userInput = "USER_INPUT";
document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = userInput;
```

If an attacker inputs something like:

```javascript
"; alert('XSS'); //
```

The resulting JavaScript would be:

```javascript
var userInput = ""; alert('XSS'); //";
document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = userInput;
```

Here’s what happens:
1. The `"` closes the `value` attribute.
2. `-->` ends the HTML comment, effectively breaking out of the attribute context.
3. `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` is the injected script.
4. `<!--` starts a new comment, which comments out the rest of the attribute.

#### HTML

Consider a web application that includes user input within a JavaScript context without proper sanitization:

```html
<input type="text" value="USER_INPUT">
```

If an attacker inputs something like:

```html
" --><script>alert('XSS')</script><!--
```

The resulting HTML would be:

```html
<input type="text" value="" --><script>alert('XSS')</script><!--">
```

Here’s what happens:
1. The `"` closes the string.
2. `;` ends the current statement.
3. `alert('XSS');` is the injected script.
4. `//` starts a single-line comment, commenting out the rest of the line.
    - One could also use `/*` to start a multi-line comment, nullifying the rest of the code block.
